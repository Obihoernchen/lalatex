# LaLaTeX
LaLaTeX is a python based compiler that creates PDF files from documents written in a simple markup language.
A pre-built Users Guide can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7qry47nmfsgpphs/LaLaTeX_Users_Guide-v0.6.0.pdf?dl=0). Note, that you should build your own version later.

## Fast and quick start
Not yet completed, but in short
* Copy leftlogo.png and lalatex into a directory of your choice
* Run lalatex --makedoc (-m) to create your Users Guide. Note, that most likely some packages will be missing (texlive-latex), so install what is missing
* Note: it might be somewhat tricky on some distros with the Latex packages and lalatex might hang. Check log files in this case and try to run pdflatex on the compiled .tex file to get more infos on what was going wron.
* If everything works fine, you get a Users Guide PDF - the code is "self contained" in the lalatex script
More infos to follow.
